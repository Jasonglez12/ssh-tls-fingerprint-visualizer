---

## ⚠️ Still Needed for Submission

### 1. Docker & Make Setup (CRITICAL)
**Requirement:** `make up && make demo` must work on fresh clone

**What's Completed:**
- ✅ Dockerfile created for C++ build environment (multi-stage build)
- ✅ Updated docker-compose.yml for full stack
- ✅ `make demo` target created with end-to-end vertical slice
- ✅ Demo script (`scripts/demo.sh`) implements full workflow
- ⚠️ Needs testing on clean environment

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Implementation complete, testing needed

---

### 2. Testing Suite (CRITICAL)
**Requirement:** Alpha + Beta tests with CI coverage

**What's Completed:**
- ✅ Alpha tests: Happy-path and negative tests created (`test_integration.cpp`)
- ✅ Beta tests: Unit tests for utils module (`test_utils.cpp`)
- ✅ Edge case tests included (empty baseline, invalid input)
- ✅ CI configuration (GitHub Actions workflow created)
- ✅ Coverage summary generation in CI
- ⚠️ Test framework could be enhanced (currently using simple asserts)

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Basic tests in place, can be expanded

---

### 3. Observability & Logging (IMPORTANT)
**Requirement:** Logging + metrics export + hardening

**What's Completed:**
- ✅ Metrics export: JSON/CSV formats (visualize tool)
- ✅ Least-privilege execution: Docker runs as non-root user
- ✅ Console logging: Key steps logged during execution
- ✅ Input validation: Hostname/port validation in place
- ⚠️ Could enhance: Structured logging library, rate limiting, detailed audit logs

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW - Core requirements met

---

### 4. Evidence Artifacts (IMPORTANT)
**Requirement:** `artifacts/release/` with pcaps, charts, logs

**What's Completed:**
- ✅ `artifacts/release/` directory structure created
- ✅ Subdirectories: charts/, logs/, pcaps/
- ✅ README.md and VERIFICATION.md documentation
- ⚠️ Needs: Actual sample files (will be generated by demo)

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Structure ready, needs sample files

---

### 5. Evaluation Progress (IMPORTANT)
**Requirement:** Datasets + charts + draft results

**What's Completed:**
- ✅ Draft results section: `EVALUATION.md` created
- ✅ Initial observations documented
- ✅ Performance metrics included
- ✅ Use case effectiveness ratings
- ⚠️ Needs: More collected data (can be generated by running demo)

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW - Documentation complete, data collection ready

---

### 6. Documentation (CRITICAL)
**Requirement:** Architecture, runbook, security, summary, demo video

**What's Completed:**
- ✅ Architecture README: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (system design, components, data flow)
- ✅ Runbook: `docs/RUNBOOK.md` (rebuild instructions, troubleshooting)
- ✅ Security invariants: `docs/SECURITY.md` (security guarantees, hardening)
- ✅ 1-page summary: `docs/SUMMARY.md` (what works / what's next)
- ⚠️ Still needed: Demo video/GIF (≤2 minutes)

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM - All docs complete except video

---

## 📊 Completion Status

## 🎯 Remaining Tasks

### Critical (Must Complete)
1. ⚠️ **Test Docker Setup** - Verify `make up && make demo` works on clean environment
2. ⚠️ **Demo Video** - Record 2-minute demo showing vertical slice

### Important (For Full Points)
3. ⚠️ **Generate Sample Artifacts** - Run demo and populate `artifacts/release/` with actual files
4. ✅ **Add CI Badges** - README.md updated with GitHub Actions badge
5. ⚠️ **Final Testing** - Test on fresh clone to ensure ≤5 minute setup time

### Optional Enhancements
6. Enhance test coverage with framework (Google Test/Catch2)
7. Add structured logging library
8. Implement rate limiting
9. Create sample PCAP files for artifacts
